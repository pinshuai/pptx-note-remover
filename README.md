pptx-note-remover
=================

Python script to remove notes from PPTX Powerpoint files. This is useful for people using versions of Powerpoint (e.g. PowerPoint for Mac 2011) that don't have this functionality. Note that this only works for PPTX files, not PPT.

See http://andrewfong.com/blog/2011/10/04/remove-notes-from-powerpoint-pptx/ for more details.

To use on the command line:

```
python drop_pptx_here.py DIR_TO_PPTX
```
